Change Log v3

Added a new method to DatabaseHelper: getAllOrdersWithCustomerNames();

Added a new commamd to Command:  GetAllOrdersWithCustomerNamesCommand();

Registered the new command in Command Registry: commands.put("GET_ALL_ORDERS_WITH_CUSTOMER_NAMES", new GetAllOrdersWithCustomerNamesCommand());

Added new method to ClerkCommandHelper: getAllOrdersWithCustomerNames();

Replaced the old processShipReqPanel() within ClerkFrame to allow the customer's paid status to reflect in the clerk's interface

Added a new method to ClerkFrame:  viewInvoiceForShipment(String trackingNumber); -- very important in allowing the clerk to view the customer's invoices 

Replaced the assignPackagesPanel() method in the ClerkFrame.


NOTES:

1. The updates now fix a issue i was having where the customer paid status was not being refelected in the handle payments section. 
2. Additionally, a edit has been made where if the user has paid an invoice, the clerk will not be able to edit that specific row. (security feature ig)
3. The "Process Shipment Requests" and "Assign Packages" tab support hot reloading when a combobox is selected. (automatic refresh)
	However, for the "Handle Payments" the refresh tab has to be pressed to show the most up-to-date information
